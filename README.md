# Using ChatGPT to play Video games

## Abstract
Recent advancements in NLP have led to the advent of Large Language Models being implemented in systems we interact with daily. While these models excel in providing useful information, studies have shown that responses generated by them contain a certain level of inaccuracies. This makes us question the reasoning capabilities of these language models and to what extent the information presented by them is accurate. In this project, I incorporate a state-of-the-art model, GPT-4, into two video game environments, MiniRTS and Minecraft. The main objective of the project is to assess GPT-4’s ability to generate logical, accurate and contextualised responses. GPT-4 is asked to play MiniRTS by generating natural language instructions while prompted to provide assistive suggestions to players’ queries in Minecraft. I conducted a qualitative analysis in both games and additionally carried out a user study in Minecraft to evaluate game performance and the generated responses. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4 struggles to generate logical and strategic responses in long gameplay. Furthermore, the responses are generally accurate but are subject to imprecision and inconsistency, particularly in lengthy answers. GPT-4 also shows significant effort in considering prompts but fails to show a deep understanding of them. Lastly, compared to existing studies, GPT performs relatively weak in generating responses in real-time. The study ends by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-4. It is hoped that further studies will address these limitations and advance the capabilities of Large Language Models.

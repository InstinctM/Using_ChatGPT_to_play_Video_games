# Using ChatGPT to play Video games

## Abstract
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing have led to the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) being implemented in systems we interact with daily. While these models excel in providing useful information, studies have shown that responses generated by them contain a certain level of inaccuracies. This makes us question the reasoning capabilities of these language models and to what extent the information presented by them is accurate. In this project, I incorporate a state-of-the-art model, GPT-4V, into two video game environments, MiniRTS and Minecraft. The project's main objective is to assess GPT-4V’s ability to generate logical, accurate and contextualised responses. GPT-4V is asked to play MiniRTS by generating natural language instructions while prompted to provide assistive suggestions to players’ queries in Minecraft. I conducted a qualitative analysis in both games and additionally carried out a user study in Minecraft to evaluate game performance and the generated responses. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4V struggles to generate logical and strategic responses in long gameplay. Furthermore, the responses are generally accurate but are subject to imprecision and inconsistency, particularly in lengthy answers. GPT-4V also shows significant effort in considering prompts but fails to show a deep understanding of them. Lastly, compared to existing studies, GPT-4V performs relatively weakly in generating responses in real-time. The study ends by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-4V. It is hoped that further studies will address these limitations and advance the capabilities of LLMs.

## Design
For this study, GPT-4V has been chosen to be incorporated into MiniRTS and Minecraft for experiments.

MiniRTS is a simplified version of the Real-Time Strategy game genre, in which players are required to analyse the current game environment through images and inform the game about the next step with textual instructions. In this study, I have adopted the MiniRTS environment proposed by H. Hu et al. [1] MiniRTS provides a simple but stochastic environment, and incorporates both visual and textual information, allowing me to put GPT-4V's reasoning capabilities to the test. 

Minecraft is a sandbox game, offering a vast and dynamic environment with high diversity and customisability for evaluation. Minecraft utilises visual cues in a 3D environment, players will have to identify each block and entity to progress in tasks. Moreover, it also utilises textual information such as coordinates and biome. Through experiments, it enables me to measure to what extent GPT-4V generates accurate and succient inforamtion.
